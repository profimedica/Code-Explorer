Fast way to start working with a new project

Working on a new project can be difficult. 
You have to find out how it works. 
You are bored of bad architecture, outdated documentation, work-arounds. 
All you want is to KNOW how it works. And you need it today.
This is what I am starting. 
An code intruder that will tell you things you`ve probably never thought about.

It will "destroy" the code, so... work on a copy and keep your original safe !
The application analiye the code and insert a logging system.
Using Graphviz you will be able to have a graphical perspective.
